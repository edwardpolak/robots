Remake of the old skool Unix System V version of the robots game.
Added option -r to spawn each level at a random position (vs. in the center) and option -p for the ability to push rocks (horizontally and vertically only).

The binary will run on Linux systems with ncurses installed.
To compile, you need to have libncurses-dev installed, e.g.:
sudo apt install libncurses-dev
